Waste generation is a trend that keeps increasing over the years and is something we cannot avoid. According to EPA US, the total generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) in 2018 was 292.4 million tons (U.S. short tons, unless specified) or 4.9 pounds per person per day. Some of these waste are not only harmful to the environment but when left untreated and exposed cause serious diseases to animals and human beings. Talking about recent times, the amount of infectious or biomedical waste accumulated has increased metronomically by 121 % since the pandemic hit. Keeping in mind, this data is apart from the waste accumulated from Covid patients treated under home isolation. This is a matter of serious concern to be taken care of right from the the point of generation of these wastes, that is from our homes. We need to be aware on how to treat this waste and how to dispose them in ways that our environment stays unaffected or least affected.
